# 0x03-ES6 Data Manipulation

## Description
In this project, I explored how to manipulate data in JavaScript using ES6 features. The primary goal was to work with arrays and objects efficiently while making use of modern JavaScript capabilities such as arrow functions, the spread operator, object destructuring, and more. I gained hands-on experience with ES6 array methods such as map(), filter(), reduce(), and how to manipulate objects for various use cases.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I was able to:

- Understand and use different ES6 data manipulation techniques.
- Apply ES6 array methods to process and transform data.
- Work with objects and arrays in a clean and efficient way using ES6 syntax.
- Handle more complex data operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing collections.
