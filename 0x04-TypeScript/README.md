# 0x04 - TypeScript
## Description
This project introduced me to TypeScript, a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. The primary focus of this project is to understand the basics of TypeScript, including types, interfaces, functions, and classes. I learnt how TypeScript improves the developer experience by allowing you to write safer, more readable, and maintainable code, all while taking advantage of JavaScriptâ€™s flexibility.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I was able to:

- Understand and explain the benefits of using TypeScript.
- Use static types to avoid common programming errors.
- Work with TypeScript data types, interfaces, and type annotations.
- Define and use TypeScript functions, classes, and modules.
- Compile TypeScript into JavaScript.
