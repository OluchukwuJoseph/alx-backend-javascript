# 0x01-ES6_promise
Welcome to the 0x01-ES6_promise project! This repository focuses on understanding and using Promises in JavaScript, a powerful feature introduced in ES6 to handle asynchronous operations. Promises allow developers to write cleaner, more manageable asynchronous code, avoiding callback hell and enhancing readability.

## Project Overview
During this project, I explored Promises in JavaScript. A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. This project taught me the following key concepts:

- Creating promises.
- Consuming promises using .then(), .catch(), and .finally().
- Handling multiple promises with Promise.all() and Promise.race().
- Error handling with promises.
